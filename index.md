Welcom to AMSC
======
The Arab Molecular Simulations Community (AMSC) is dedicated to fostering connections among Arab scientists and researchers specializing in computational chemistry and physics. Our primary mission revolves around nurturing collaborative efforts and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. A key pillar of our initiative is to make the field of molecular simulation more accessible to aspiring Arab researchers, primarily by disseminating information in the Arabic language.

Over the past year, we have diligently organized a series of presentations featuring expert Arab researchers. In an effort to diversify and broaden our perspectives, AMSC has made the exciting decision to extend invitations to experts from beyond the Arabic-speaking community.

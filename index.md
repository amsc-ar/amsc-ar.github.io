Welcome!
======
I am a PhD student in the [Molecular Quantum Dynamics](http://web.physik.uni-rostock.de/quantendynamik/index.html) group at the [University of Rostock](https://www.uni-rostock.de/). My [research](/research/) focus on utilizing the state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations and other computational methods (e.g., DFT and DFT-based tight binding methods) to study 2D materials interfaces with liquid.

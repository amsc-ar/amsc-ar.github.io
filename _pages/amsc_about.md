The Arab Molecular Simulations Community (AMSC) is a dynamic group founded by a team of enthusiastic young Arab researchers with a deep passion for computational chemistry, physics, and molecular simulations. Our main goal is to foster connections among Arab scientists and researchers who share a keen interest in these fields.

At the heart of our mission is a commitment to promoting collaboration and sharing knowledge within our community. We're determined to demystify the complex world of molecular simulation, making it more accessible to emerging Arab researchers. One of our key strategies is to provide information and resources in the Arabic language, ensuring that valuable insights are within reach for a wider audience.

Over the past year, we've worked hard to organize a series of presentations featuring accomplished Arab researchers. To broaden our horizons and offer fresh perspectives, AMSC is excited to extend invitations to experts from diverse backgrounds, reaching beyond the Arabic-speaking community. Together, we aim to elevate the fields of computational chemistry and physics, transcending language and geographical boundaries.
